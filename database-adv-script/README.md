# Database Optimization Toolkit

## Project Overview
This folder contains all the work related to designing, optimizing, and monitoring a relational database. The goal is to ensure efficient data storage, fast query execution, and scalability as the database grows.

The work included covers:

- **Complex Queries** – Creating and testing joins, subqueries, and aggregation queries for retrieving related data across multiple tables.  
- **Query Refactoring** – Simplifying queries, reducing unnecessary columns, and improving execution plans.  
- **Indexing** – Adding indexes on high-usage columns to speed up lookups and joins.  
- **Table Partitioning** – Splitting large tables (e.g., bookings) into partitions based on ranges (like dates) to optimize query performance.  
- **Performance Monitoring** – Using tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to measure query performance, identify bottlenecks, and validate optimizations.

## Folder Structure & Purpose

- **performance.sql**  
  Contains queries for testing database performance, including complex joins and aggregations.

- **refactored_queries.sql**  
  Optimized versions of queries that reduce memory usage and improve execution times.

- **partitioning.sql**  
  Scripts to create partitioned tables and insert sample data for large datasets.

- **indexes.sql**  
  Scripts to create and manage indexes on frequently queried columns.

- **reports/**  
  Contains performance reports, observations, and summaries based on query execution plans.

## Key Goals Achieved

- **Optimized Query Performance**: Reduced sequential scans and memory usage by refactoring queries and adding indexes.  
- **Scalable Database Design**: Implemented table partitioning for large datasets to improve efficiency.  
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Demonstrated continuous performance tracking and optimization using query execution plans.  
- **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure and documentation make it easier to extend or modify the database in the future.

## Intended Audience

- Developers and database administrators looking for examples of query optimization, indexing, and partitioning.  
- Learners seeking a practical guide for improving relational database performance.

## Conclusion
This folder serves as a comprehensive database optimization toolkit, focusing on performance, scalability, and maintainability. It provides both queries and analysis reports to ensure that the database performs efficiently even as data grows.
